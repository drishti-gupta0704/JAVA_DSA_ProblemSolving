# Mastering Arrays in Java

This package contains my Java programs for practicing **array-based DSA problems**.  
I am solving these problems to cover **several patterns of problem-solving**, improve my logical thinking, and strengthen my DSA skills.

## Purpose

- Arrays act as the **foundation of all data structures**, so mastering them is crucial.
- This package helps in understanding **array traversal, manipulation, and core problem-solving techniques**.
- Focus is on **learning patterns, building logic, and improving efficiency**.

## Goal

- To **develop a strong foundation in arrays**, which is essential for tackling **advanced data structures and algorithms**.
- To **practice systematically**, covering different problem-solving patterns in arrays.
- To **improve problem-solving skills through consistent coding practice**.
